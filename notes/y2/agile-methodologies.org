* Feature Driven Development (FDD) SDLC
  - Works with the concept of classes that must be integrated to the deliver the full set
  - More model-driven approach. Aka "plan by feature", allows to support large projects and teams
  - To manage requirements FDD breaks features into three levels
    - Highest level: problem domain/subject area that is broken down into the
    - Business activity
    - Individual features
  - Uses the parking lots method to track progress
  [[file:images/Agile_FDD_ParkingLots.png]]

* Kanban SDLC
  - Just-in-time development and evolving the process to create on optimal system
  - Uses a visual signboard and a work-in-progress pull method
  - Does not use iterations (although it can), advocates continuous workflow
  - Fits projects that are unpredictable, with unplanned workflow, and require deployment in less time than a typical iteration

** Four key principles:
   - *Foster leadership at all levels of the organization*: everyone is encouraged to act as a leader, at any level (even entry).
   - *Start with what you know*: Understand where you are today and evolve from that point.
   - *Focus on incremental an evolutionary change*: Do not make drastic changes. Evolve slowly but makes changes to be impactful.
   - *Respect current methodologies and roles*: Remember that the current process is used for a reason. Makes changes only if certain methods do not help the team.
** Core practices:
   - *Visualize workflow*: Kanban board with columns to visualise the workflow.
   - *Limit work in progress, and pull in new work only when time becomes available*: Focus on working with a single task at a time.
   - *Manage the flow through the system*: Like a relay race, understand the flow of work. Keep bottlenecks to minimum.
   - *Provide explicit policies*: The team needs to understand how to work in order to eliminate ambiguity
   - *Improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally*: Improvement is best in teamwork, via shared vision. However, all improvements must be evaluated and experimented upon.
   - *Ensure feedback is part of the process*: Positive and Negative feedback are as valuable

** Kanban task board
   - Visualize the workflow
   - Limit work in progress
   - Measure the lead time

** WIP limits
   - Allows to see a bottleneck in the process. Each column (apart from the *TODO* and *COMPLETED*) can have a WIP limit.
   - Prevent the product owner from forcing too much work.
   - WIP limits can be set by story points amount
   - Limits allow to see the time that a task takes from *TODO* to *COMPLETED*

* Test template
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  Test Number
  Test Objective
  Test Type (jUnit or UAT)
  Input(s)
  Expected Output(s)
  Test Procedure (UAT)
  #+END_VERSE

* Product Backlog
  - Full list of desired features (user stories)
  - Highest priority stories on the top with the highest level of detail
  - Backlogs vary in depth, breadth and quality
  - *DEEP* guidance while creating the backlog:
    - *D* etailed appropriately: Highest priority stories must contain a high level of detail. All necessary clarifications are in the acceptance criteria.
    - *E* stimated: Means that the team understands the complexity and knows how long it will take to develop the user story.
    - *E* mergent: Adapts to evolution of the competition, marketplace, customer, technology, etc.
    - *P* rioritized: User stories are prioritized by their importance to the business.

* Working Agreement
  - Document with a set of expectations that define how the team is going to work together
  - Is the first point of collaboration for the team
  - More than just rules: working agreement reflects the values and commitment of the team.
  - Creates trust and builds up teamwork establishment
  - Example topics
    - Time and location of the daily scrum meeting
    - Testing strategies (unit, functional, integration, performance, stress, etc...)
    - Build and infrastructure plans
    - Team norms (be on time, respect, help, etc...)
    - How to address bugs/fires during a Sprint
    - Product Owner availability (phone, office hours, attendance in Daily Scrum)
    - Capacity plan for initial Sprint

* Definition of DONE
  - Meaningful conversation between the development team, the stakeholders and the product owner to understand what is meant by "completion"
  - Different people might have a different understanding of the word *DONE*
    - Should code reviews be in the definition?
    - Should the documentation be updated before the sprint is done?
    - Etc.
  - Make sure that everyone is on the same page, so that the expectations are the same across the team

* Prioritization Techniques

** Based on Value

*** Potential Pros
    - Increase revenue
    - Expansion of addressable market
    - Decreased cost
    - Increase customer satisfaction
    - Increase processing speed
    - Increase stability
    - Improve usability

*** Potential Cons
    - The cost of developing the feature must be lower then its possible income
    - If the cost of developing the feature is too high then the feature deteriorates and should be de-prioritized
    - New feature might cause a hit on the stability or performance of the application

** Value Stream Mapping
   - The entire process is viewed from the customer's perspective, allows to see potential breakpoints and bottlenecks from a customer's perspective
   - The application should not have any breakpoints
   - The application should be functional
   - Make sure that the application flows seamlessly
   - Customer experience must be optimised

** MoSCoW
   - *Must have*: All compulsory features that need to be implemented for the system to work and to satisfy the customer
   - *Should have*: Important but can be omitted if time or resources do not allow it
   - *Could have*: System enhancements with great functionality, however, not critical
   - *Want to have*: Features that serve only a limited amount of people, do not provide a decent amount of business value

** Kano Model

*** Characteristics
    - *Basic needs*: All compulsory features that need to be implemented for the system to work and to satisfy the customer
    - *Performance Needs*: Customer experience enhancements and bottleneck removers
    - *Delights*: Unexpected bonuses in the project that excite the customer and add business value

*** Notes
    - Provide a good amount of *Basic Needs*, *Performance Needs* and *Delights* to deliver a great product
    - Too many *Delights* will not give any functionality
    - Too many *Basic Needs* will not excite the customer
    - With time *Delights* become *Performance Needs*, and *Performance Needs* become *Basic Needs*
    - To remain innovative prioritize *Delights*

* Estimation Techniques
  - One of the hardest things to do in software development

** Level of Effort (LoE) or T-Shirt sizing
   - Least accurate, but is the most simple
   - Uses only three levels of description: *small*, *medium* and *large*
   - Some teams add *extra small* and *extra large*

*** Pros
    - Simple
    - Quick

*** Cons
    - Lack of precision
    - Inability to add up several user stories into a meaningful measure

** Ideal Time (Days or Hours)
   - The developer determines the ideal amount of time to develop a user story. By ideal we mean no interruptions, phone calls etc.
   - Easier than clock-in-out, since clocking does not take into account possible interruptions
   - Most of companies use the 2 to 1 ration. Meaning that every hour, 40 minutes is spent of work and 20 minutes on interruptions and breaks

*** Pros
    - *Hours* is simply the amount of hours that the team will spend to develop a user story
    - Convenient since there is only one definition of an hour

*** Cons
    - During an early stage of planning the amount of hours could be not precise
    - Great risk of the stakeholders and executives to place high expectations due to estimated hours

** Story Points

*** Characteristics
    - Points are an arbitrary measure used mostly in SCRUM
    - Usually use numbers from the Fibonacci sequence to describe the difficulty level of a user story: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
    - Usually a story above 13, would be considered an Epic
    - Some teams replace the 21 with a 20 and add 40 and a 100, this approach allows to clearly see Epics that need to be broken down
    - Sometimes an ∞ symbol or a high number in the hundreds is used to describe a story that cannot be accurately estimated due to lack of knowledge
    - However if a 100 point story takes a month to develop, that does not mean that another story worth 100 will also take that long
    - Story points are abstract and negotiable (different skill levels of developers may assign different points)
    - *Zero* points indicates a dependency, a story that is a placeholder and needs to be completed by a different team

*** Starting evaluation
    - Relative sizing, start with a task that the whole team is familiar with
    - Example: say that adding a new field to the DB is 5 points and all team members know how much effort it is. Then every other story is compared to this 5 pointer, this helps to evaluate stories more accurately
    - Remember to include testing activities in the story points. Same as designing, planning and coding.

** 50/90 Estimation
   - In a lot of cases the developers consider the rough estimate user story difficulty and the worst case scenario
   - It is unfair to the customer as it adds potential costs upon him/her via the buffer added to the stories
   - The 50/90 technique allows to remove the rough estimate and calculate a more accurate buffer
   - The 50 value is the most likely estimation and the 90 is the worst case scenario
   - The value is calculates as follows: √(a^2 - b^2), where *a* is the most likely estimation and *b* is the worst case scenario

* Team Participation Estimation Techniques

** Planning Poker
   - Each team member is given a set of cards with Fibonacci values
   - After discussing a feature and making sure that the understanding of it is thorough, all team members reveal their cards at the same time
   - First we look if there is a high amount of discrepancy. Did someone throw a 2 and someone else a 13? This may reveal a lack of common understanding of the feature
   - Encourage a conversation
   - After evaluating all problems the team agrees on a story point
   - Can be used [[https://www.planningpoker.com/][online]] if all the team members are not available in the same place

** Wide-Band Delphi
   - Similar to Planning Poker but more structured and formal
   - Facilitator calls a meeting to discuss features
   - Expert participants fill in anonymous forms and submit them to the facilitator
   - Facilitator compiles the results and maintains them as anonymous
   - Based on the new inputs, the experts team discuss the feature again, try to understand it better
   - The process is repeated until all agree upon the value

*** Pros
    - Provides better accuracy

*** Cons
    - More time consuming

* Grooming
  - During the development the requirements and the user stories are groomed into functional input for the team
  - The priority of the user stories and their size is important before committing to work
  - Grooming and planning are critical activities since they incorporate valuable Agile principles, such as: self-organizing, face-to-face meetings, sustainable work environment, frequent delivery
  - If the team does not put in the effort into grooming and planning, they are likely to fail during development as well

** Grooming in SCRUM
   - Prioritization and Estimation often take place during Grooming
   - Grooming session is also used to:
     - Improve and clarify user stories
     - Breaking down Epics
     - Improving poorly written stories
     - Adding acceptance criteria
   - Once features are understood, a discussion about Prioritization occurs
   - The goal of the session is to leave the session with user stories prioritized, discussed, well understood, negotiated, agreed upon
   - Product owner is to lead the session


* Planning
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  Once the grooming session is completed and the team understands the highest priority user stories, the team proceeds to the Sprint Planning
  #+END_VERSE

** Velocity
   - The team, after a few sprints get an idea of what is their Velocity
   - The Velocity indicates how much the team can deliver in a specified time frame (usually a Sprint)
   - Story points are usually used to measure Velocity
   - Some teams use hours as their Velocity
   - New teams struggle to estimate their Velocity. Usually it is guesswork, but it allows to inspect and adapt.
   - Great tool to measure commitment in the feature
   - Team should be stable, no new members, and work full-time to measure Velocity properly
   - Vacations and training might affect Velocity
   - Also external elements such as infrastructure stability might affect Velocity
   - Velocity is evaluated throughout the entire development
   - Velocity is based on user story points and thus is not a real measure of comparison between different teams, due to the arbitrary nature of story points.
   - Velocity is not an indicator of performance or productivity
   - Some teams use the average of all sprints to measure Velocity, some only take the last two (as it could potentially be more accurate)

** Technical Debt
   - Sometimes to achieve a goal before the deadline, the team might knowingly or unknowingly create technical debt
   - Technical debts are things that the team choose not to do now, but that might impede future development if left undone
   - Two types of debt:
     - Intentional: Incurred as a trade-off, strategic reasons
     - Unintentional: created due to a learning curve, poor testing, etc.
   - Bottom lines is that, do not allow for Technical Debt to fester

** Bugs
   - Defects in code
   - Different than Technical Debt, in that they impede performance or usability of the application
   - In many companies there is a designated process to deal with Bugs
   - Depending of the Bug's impact it may have to be prioritized

** Inputs on Sprint Planning Meeting
   - Groomed and prioritized backlog
   - Estimates for user stories
   - Velocity
   - Definition of Done
   - Schedule of the sprint, vacations, work days, etc.

** Process
   - Understand the User Stories, bring others up to speed if absent
   - Decide how many user stories to commit to
   - Break user stories to individual tasks (some teams skip this and a developer is responsible for the whole user story)
   - Each member selects the tasks/user stories
   - Each team member estimates the amount of time (hours) to completed the task/user story

** Output
   - The goal of the meeting: user stories are committed for the sprint
   - The backlog itself which is a TO DO list

** Chickens and Pigs
   #+BEGIN_VERSE
   During planning the product owner is the Pig, since he/she demand on what needs to be done. Then the product owner turns into a Chicken, since he/she will not do the work, while the conversation moves to describing the work that needs to be done.
   #+END_VERSE

* Test Techniques and Measures
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  Each techniques has its own design and its own coverage items.
  #+END_VERSE

** Definitions
   - *Coverage item*: An entity or property used as a basis for test coverage, e.g. equivalence partitions or code statements
   - *Coverage*: The degree, expressed as a percentage, to which a specified coverage item has been exercised by a test suite.
   - *Coverage (measurement) Tool*: A tool that provides objective measures of what structural elements have been exercised by a test suite.

** Black Box
*** Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
**** Test case design
     - Test cases are designed to test for valid and invalid values in both inputs and outputs
     - Test case should comprise of:
       - The inputs
       - The partitions exercised
       - The expected outcome
**** Coverage
     #+BEGIN_VERSE
     Coverage items is calculated by : (number of covered partitions) / (total number of partitions) * 100%
     #+END_VERSE
**** Process
     - Read requirements
     - Divide the range of possible inputs and outputs into partitions
     - We test at least one value from each class
*** Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
**** Test case design
     - Test values at the boundaries of values of partitions
     - The max and min values of a partition are the boundaries
     - Boundary value the output as well
     - Test case should comprise of:
       - The inputs
       - The boundaries exercised
       - The expected outcome
**** Coverage
     #+BEGIN_VERSE
     Coverage items is calculated by : (number of distinct boundary values executed) / (total number of boundary values coverage) * 100%
     #+END_VERSE
*** Classification Trees (CT)
**** Test case design
     - Aimed at preparing test cases
     - Suits a case in which multiple conditions are required to satisfy the output
**** Coverage
     - The number of ideal test cases is left to the developer
     - However, based on the classification tree one can deduce the *minimum criterion*. Minimum criterion is the number of test cases in which each leaf class in included at least once in a test case spec.
     - The *maximum criterion* is the number of test cases if all combinations would be executed
     - The ideal number of test cases is between the max and min criterion, however, the developer should design the minimum amount of test cases to save time.
**** Example
     - A grid showing sample inputs for desired outcomes
     [[file:images/Test Techniques and Measures/screenshot_2018-04-25_12-10-51.png]]

** White Box

*** Statement Coverage
    - Involves: assignments, loops, procedure and function calls, variable declarations, etc.
    - Coverage: (number of statements executed) / (total number of executable statements) * 100%
*** Branch Coverage
    - Designed to specifically test branches
    - A 100% Branch coverage implies that all branch paths have been executed in the test
    - Coverage: (number of executed branch outcomes) / (total number of branch outcomes) * 100%
*** McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity Metric
    - Checks all the possible paths within a program, however the depth can be specified
    - The number of independent paths through a program is the *Cyclomatic Complexity (V)* and is defined as: *L - N + 2P*, where:
      - *L* is the number of edges/links in a graph
      - *N* is the number of nodes in a graph
      - *P* is the number of disconnected parts of the graph (eg. a called method or a function)

* System State

** Definition
   - A state defines the current conditions of a system at a given time
   - For a given state the system will:
     - Process certain inputs only
     - Allow the system state to change to a different system state
   - A state transition consists of:
     - Initial state
     - Input that causes a transition in the next/final state
     - Next/final state
     - Output that accompanies the transition

** Diagrams
   - State transition diagrams are useful to model changes in behaviour
   [[file:images/System State/screenshot_2018-04-25_16-38-22.png]]
   - *Dead states* are not allowed
   - *Unreachable states* are also not allowed

** Testing
   - Appropriate when the system is described as a set of states and transitions
   - Testing determines if the states change correctly
   - Design:
     - Draw the state diagram
     - Convert to a state transition table
     - Derive test data for the state transitions

* Meetings or Ceremonies

** Daily Stand-up
   - Answer three key question:
     - What has been completed?
     - What do you plan to do by the next meeting?
     - What is getting in the way?
   - Open to all stakeholders
   - Provide opportunity for *team calibration*
   - Provide opportunity to support other team members
   - Usually takes about 15 min or less
   - Quick status check
   - Help others with any struggle
   - Prepare the team for the day
   - Not designed to solve problems, rather have a discussion about the problem
   - Scrum master needs to keep the discussion on topic and disable non-topic discussion
   - Daily meetings can decrease the amount of tedious long meetings

** Sprint Review (Demo)
   - Open to all stakeholders and potentially customers as well
   - Showcasing the current work
   - Inform what has been completed
   - Gather feedback
   - Focus on showcasing the product rather than the presentation itself
   - Product owner must accept or reject the user stories
   - Product owner should evaluate the business value of new suggestions proposed during the demo
   - Process:
     - Describe user stories tackled
     - Preferably have the product owner showcase. Since non-technical person demoing, shows the product's usability
     - There is nothing wrong with the developers demoing, they can describe best, on what has been done
     - Evaluate feedback, be it negative or positive

** Retrospectives
   - Retrospective is a team meeting at the end of a sprint that provides the opportunity to inspect and adapt teamwork
   - Is a critical meeting and is and the core of Agile
   - One way of facilitating the discussion is to provide cards for each team member and provide categories such as: stop doing, start doing, continue
   - Example:

   | Start Doing                               | Stop Doing                                                | Continue                   |
   |-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------|
   | Recalculate velocity after each iteration | Allow the daily stand-up meeting to last more than 15 min | Team lunch on Fridays      |
   |                                           |                                                           |                            |
   | Enroll the team in a clean coding course  | Write new code when unresolved defects exist              | Customer feedback sessions |

   - Retrospectives allow to discuss workflow and how to enhance it
   - Retrospectives can be awkward, as personal opinions and personal matters might arise. However, this is the best way to improve the workflow and remove obstacles.
   - Retrospectives allow for the team to grow as a singular unit
   - Example method:
     - Each team member writes down the action that they want to address on a post-it note
     - Each team member is given a set amount of dot stickers (usually 3, 5, 8; depends on the team size)
     - The notes are put up on the board
     - The team members assign dots to the notes that they would like to address the most
     - The note with the most dots is the top priority to be resolved, then next, so on...

** Measuring Success
   - *Do it fast*: measure the teams' productivity and their responsiveness
   - *Do it right*: measure quality and customer satisfaction
   - *Do it on time*: demonstrate predictability for when software is delivered
   - *Keep doing it*: measure employee satisfaction

   #+BEGIN_VERSE
   Customer satisfaction is perhaps the most important measure of success.
   If the software was delivered on time and the customer is satisfied then the project might be considered a success.
   #+END_VERSE

* Triple Constraints
  - Scope is how much is done
  - Resources is how many people are available
  - Time is when the project will be released
  [[file:images/triple_constraints.png]]

* Tracking
  - Increased transparency and eliminates surprises

** Tracking in XP
   - Designated *tracker* role
   - Tracker asks all developers two questions: how many days(hours) are on the current task, and how many days(hours) are left.
   - Tracker should talk to the developer about the task status
   - Reinforce face-to-face communications
   - In scrum the equivalent is in the daily stand-up

** Progress charts

*** Burn up chart
    - Tracking the progress of the project
    - Track by expected points, by total points or by feature

*** Burn down chart
    - Tracking the progress of the sprint
    - Updated daily during the status check
    - Allows to identify issues as early as possible

*** Charts examples
    - Burn Up
    [[file:images/Agile_BurnUp.png]]
    - Burn up by feature
    [[file:images/Agile_BurnUp_by_feature.png]]
    - Burn down
    [[file:images/Agile_BurnDown.png]]

** Information Radiators
   - Anything posted in the team members' physical space that they will see every day, on a regular basis.
   - Work like ads or billboards, work on the subconsciousness
   - The radiator could be the working agreement, the burn down chart, best practices, etc.

** FDD's parking lots
   - Uses the parking lots method to track progress
   [[file:images/Agile_FDD_ParkingLots.png]]
   - By simply reading the colours of each "lot" the reader is able to tell if the project is in jeopardy
   - Allows to scale and support large projects

** Other Common methods
   - Gantt chart
   - Stoplight chart

* Tracking quality

** Meaning
   - There are preventive measures such as: TTD and paired-programming
   - There are several approaches to tracking the quality of the product

** Build status
   - Look for errors after the code has been integrated
   - Usually found quickly, Agile teams execute builds frequently
   - Easier to narrow down errors if the builds are frequent
   - Some teams introduce sirens or alarms when build errors occur, embarrassing, and thus most of developers reduce build errors

** Defects
   - Some teams use a defect burn down chart
   - Sometimes defect quality is measured as a ratio of X amount of lines of code built and the amount of defects provided

** Test cases
   - Write test code that will uncover defects
   - Ensure highest quality via thorough tests
   - Cover functionality and stability
   - Use Testing Quadrants
   [[file:images/Agile_testing_quadrants.png]]

* Testing, Quality and Integration

** Quality
   - Most important are: pair programming, TDD, refactoring. These have built-in quality.
   - Testing enhances quality
   - Testing allows to maintain a consistent product and see if any future code does not break it
   - Employ TDD, to write tests before product code
   - Refactor code to improve readability and structure
   - Minimizing defects
   - Employ manual and automated testing
   - Customer feedback
     - Alpha and Beta tests
     - Usability testing
   - Quality starts with:
     - Building a quality environment where the team can work at their fullest
     - A culture focused on quality
     - Being proactive about quality
     - Daily builds and integration help manage defects

** Gherkin language for testing
   - Describes scenarios
   - *Given* as the current condition
   - *And When Then* to explain how the scenario proceeds
   - Example:
   [[file:images/Testing, Quality and Integration/screenshot_2018-04-25_17-08-44.png]]

* Mock ups

** Stubs
   - Simulate non-existent classes
   - Bare basics implementation
   - May support state verification
   - Allows to test early
   [[file:images/Mockups/screenshot_2018-03-09_11-17-08.png]]

** Mock objects
   - Create mock objects to test a method
   - Suited for testing a portion of code in isolation form the rest of the code
   - Do not implement business logic
   - Replace the objects with which the methods under test collaborate
   - Provides a wat to test code that has not yet been written

** Static and dynamic mocks
*** Static mocks are pre-written and hard-coded, extend or inherit a common interface
    - Considered a bad practice
    - Example of a static mock
    [[file:images/Mockups/screenshot_2018-03-09_11-31-12.png]]

*** Dynamic mock created at run time, avoids cluttering

    [[file:images/Mockups/screenshot_2018-03-09_11-26-44.png]]

** Mock and stub diagram
   [[file:images/Mockups/screenshot_2018-03-09_11-25-18.png]]

** Dependency Injection, aka Inversion of Control
   - Applying the IoC pattern to a class means removing the creation of all object instances for which this class is not directly responsible and passing any needed instances instead. The instances may be passed using a specific constructor, using a setter, or as parameters of the methods needing them. It becomes the responsibility of the calling code to correctly set the domain objects on the called class.
